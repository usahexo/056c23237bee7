#  Parking woes continue for Harrah's Casino

Parking at Harrah's Casino has been a hot-button issue for years, and it doesn't look like the situation is going to improve any time soon. The casino has been gradually adding more and more self-parking spots to its garage, but the number of spaces falls far short of the number of cars that need parking on busy days.

The result is predictable: long lines of cars waiting to get into the garage, crowds of people trying to jockey for a spot, and a lot of honking and yelling. Adding to the chaos is the fact that Harrah's doesn't have an attendant directing traffic, so drivers often don't know where to go or what to do.

Casino officials say they are aware of the problem and are working on a solution, but for now, visitors will just have to deal with the hassle. Here are a few tips for avoiding the worst of the congestion:

* Try not to go to Harrah's on peak days. The casino is most crowded on Fridays and Saturdays, so if you can go during the week or on a different day, you'll avoid the worst of the traffic.

* If you can't avoid going on a busy day, try coming early or late. The line starts forming early in the morning, so if you can get there before 10 or after 4, you'll have a better chance of finding a spot.

* Park in one of the satellite lots. There are three satellite lots located near Harrah's that offer free parking. They're usually less crowded than the casino garage, so you'll have an easier time finding a spot.

* Use public transportation. Harrah's is located right next to Baltimore's Light Rail stop, so taking public transportation is a great way to avoid traffic congestion altogether.

#  Where to park at Harrah's Casino? There is no one definitive answer.3. Casino visitors struggle with parking options

At any given time, Harrah's Casino has around 4,000 vehicles parked on its property. With so many cars, it can be difficult to determine where to leave your own automobile. The casino offers a range of parking options, but they all come with their own set of pros and cons.

The garage is the most expensive option, but it is also the most convenient. You can park right at the casino entrance and avoid having to walk very far in bad weather. The downside is that the garage is often full, so you may have to search for a spot.

 surface lot parking is the least expensive option, but it can also be the most inconvenient. The lots are large, so you may have to walk a long way from your car to the casino entrance. In addition, these lots are often crowded and difficult to navigate in peak times.

 valet parking is the most expensive and the most convenient option. Your car will be parked for you right at the casino entrance, and you will not have to worry about finding a space or carrying your luggage very far. The downside is that this service costs $20 per day, which can add up quickly if you are visiting the casino often.
