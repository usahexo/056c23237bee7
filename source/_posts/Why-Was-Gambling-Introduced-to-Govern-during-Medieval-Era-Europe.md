Gambling was introduced to govern during medieval era Europe as a means of taxation. The English monarchy and other European governments taxed the gambling activities of their subjects in order to generate revenue. Gambling was seen as a vice by the church and other moral authorities, but it was nonetheless heavily taxed.

#  The Relationship Between Gambling and Governance during the Medieval Era Europe

The late medieval era in Europe was a time of great transformation. The feudal system was breaking down and a new type of society was emerging.

The growth of gambling had a significant impact on governance during the medieval era. One of the key functions of government is to regulate gambling activities.
