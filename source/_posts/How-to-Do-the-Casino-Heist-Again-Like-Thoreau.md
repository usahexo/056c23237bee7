#  How to Do the Casino Heist Again Like Thoreau

 _If you're looking for a suspenseful heist that's perfect for a group of friends, try the casino heist._

## The Plan
The basic idea is to have each team member take on a specific role. One person will be the driver, one will be the lookout, one will be the hacker, and one will be the getaway driver.

_The driver will need to know how to get in and out of the casino quickly and without being noticed. The lookout will need to keep an eye out for security cameras and guards, and warn the others when it's time to move on. The hacker will need to disable the alarm system, and the getaway driver will need to be ready to leave as soon as everyone is safely out of the casino._

To make things even more complicated, you can choose to add a fifth member who will be in charge of money collection. This person will stay outside of the casino and wait for the others to come out with the loot.

## The Heist
Once you have your team in place, it's time to start planning the heist itself. Here are a few tips:

1. Make sure you know where the security cameras are located and how to avoid them.
2. Try to find a way into the casino that doesn't involve going through security. This can include sneaking in through an unlocked door or window, or finding a way to hack into the building's security system.
3. Disconnect any alarms that may go off when you break into the casino.
4. Make sure everyone knows what they're doing and what their role is in the heist.
5. Stay calm and stay focused – this is not the time for mistakes!

#  How to Steal from a Casino: The Thoreau Method


In 1854, Henry David Thoreau published "Walden," a book about his experiment in simple living. Near the end of the book, he offers a few words of wisdom on how to cheat at gambling casinos.

Thoreau's method is simple: bet on the outside bets, and never bet on the inside. The outside bets are relatively low-risk, so you can afford to lose a few times without losing too much money. And since most of the money is wagered on the inside bets, the casino is unlikely to realize that you're winning.

It might take a while to build up your winnings using this method, but it's a safe way to make extra money without getting into trouble. So next time you're feeling lucky, give Thoreau's method a try!
