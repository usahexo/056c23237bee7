It's been a while since we last played Blackout Bingo (you can find the basic rules [here](https://ambitious.com/morefunwithblackoutbingo/). But don't worry, we're picking up where we left off - and this time, we're playing to win!

As before, you'll need:

* A pen and paper
* A copy of the blackout bingo grid [here](https://ambitious.com/morefunwithblackoutbingo/)

To play, just mark off squares as you see them in the grid. The first player to fill in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of five squares wins!

Here are a few more tips to help you on your way:

1. Use the blank spaces in the grid to your advantage. When you see a number in a square, try to think of other squares that might contain that number. For instance, if you see 5 in square C3, then squares B2 and D4 might also have a 5 in them.

2. Pay attention to the patterns in the numbers. For instance, most of the time there is an odd number of squares between two neighbouring numbers. This means that if you see a number in one square, there's a good chance its neighbour will be the next number up or down on the grid. So for example, if you see 4 in square G4, then square G5 is likely to have a 5 in it.

3. Look out for repeated numbers. If you see the same number twice in quick succession, it's likely that both squares contain that number. So for example, if you see 22 twice in quick succession, then squares H22 and I22 both have a 22 in them!
