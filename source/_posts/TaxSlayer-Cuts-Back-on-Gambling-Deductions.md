#  TaxSlayer Cuts Back on Gambling Deductions

TaxSlayer, the popular tax preparation software, is cracking down on taxpayers who claim gambling deductions. The company announced this week that it will no longer allow its users to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income.

This change is likely to affect many people who gamble regularly. Gambling losses can be a significant source of tax savings, so TaxSlayer’s decision may cost some people a lot of money.

The new policy is generating a lot of backlash from taxpayers and tax professionals alike. Some argue that it’s unfair to penalize people for gambling responsibly. Others maintain that the change is necessary to prevent abuses of the deduction system.

No matter where you stand on the issue, it’s clear that TaxSlayer’s decision will have a major impact on taxpayers across the country.

#  TaxSlayer Tightens Rules on Gambling Deduction

TaxSlayer, the popular tax-filing software, announced a new policy on gambling deductions Monday.

The new rules, which will take effect for the 2018 tax year, tightens the restrictions on what types of gambling expenses can be deducted.

The change comes after an IRS crackdown on taxpayers who claimed excessive gambling losses in previous years.

"Taxpayers need to be aware that the IRS is scrutinizing claims for gambling losses more closely than ever before," said TaxSlayer CEO Jesse Fowler. "Our new policy reflects that scrutiny and will ensure that only legitimate gambling expenses are deducted."

Under the new policy, taxpayers can only deduct gambling expenses if they itemize their deductions. In addition, the total amount of gambling losses deductible cannot exceed the amount of gambling income reported on the return.

"This change is designed to protect taxpayers from being penalized by the IRS for claiming excessive losses," Fowler said. "We want our users to stay in compliance with IRS rules and avoid any penalties or interest charges."

#  TaxSlayer Limits Gambling Losses for Deduction 



In recent years, the popularity of online gambling has skyrocketed. This has led to a corresponding increase in the amount of money people are losing gambling. To help taxpayers offset some of these losses, the IRS has put in place a rule limiting the amount of gambling losses that can be deducted on your taxes.

The limit for 2018 is $10,000. Any losses above this amount cannot be deducted on your tax return. This limit is cumulative, meaning that it includes all of your gambling losses for the year – even if they were incurred in different types of gambling activities.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you are married and file a joint tax return, you can combine your losses with your spouse's to reach the $10,000 limit. You can also deduct any gambling losses that were incurred in connection with a tax-deductible business expense.

Gambling income is fully taxable, so you must report any winnings on your tax return. However, you can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. Any excess losses cannot be used to reduce your taxable income.

It's important to keep track of your gambling activity and any resulting losses throughout the year. This information can be used to help calculate your deduction accurately on your tax return. If you don't have records of your winnings and losses, you may need to estimate them based on information from other sources.

#  TaxSlayer Reduces allowable Gambling Losses 

Taxpayers who itemize their deductions will see a decrease in the amount they can deduct for gambling losses. The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was passed in December 2017, lowered the amount of allowable losses from gambling to $2,000 per year. This is down from the previous limit of $3,000 per year.

The deduction for gambling losses has always been a tricky one to calculate. Most taxpayers do not keep track of how much money they lose while gambling, so they have to estimate the amount. In order to qualify for the deduction, you must have documentation that proves your losses. This could include receipts, credit card statements, or bank statements.

If you are a taxpayer who normally claims more than $2,000 in gambling losses each year, you may be affected by this change. You will need to carefully track your expenses going forward and make sure that you only claim $2,000 per year. If you go over this limit, you will not be able to claim the deduction at all.

There are some exceptions to the new rule. If you are a professional gambler or if your losses were incurred in a trade or business activity, you can still claim up to $3,000 in losses each year.

The decrease in the allowable gambling loss deduction is just one of many changes that taxpayers will see under the new tax law. Be sure to consult with a tax professional to see how these changes will affect you personally.

#  TaxSlayer Narrows View of Gambling Losses

TaxSlayer, a popular tax preparation software, has announced that it will no longer allow its users to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income. This change will be effective for the 2019 tax year.

According to a company spokesperson, the decision was made in order to simplify the tax preparation process for its users. "Gambling losses are a relatively complex deduction to claim," the spokesperson said. "By excluding them from our software, we can make it easier for our users to understand and file their taxes."

The change is likely to be controversial. Gambling losses are a key way for taxpayers to reduce their taxable income, and many people rely on them to stay within IRS guidelines.

A spokesperson for the National Gambling Association released a statement condemning TaxSlayer's decision. "This is just another example of the anti-gambling bias that exists in our country," the spokesperson said. "Gamblers already face enough discrimination and stigma. We urge TaxSlayer to reconsider this decision and let its users claim their rightful deductions."

But TaxSlayer is standing by its decision. "Our goal is to provide the best possible user experience," the spokesperson said. "We believe that this change will help us achieve that goal."
