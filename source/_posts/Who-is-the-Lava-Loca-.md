#  Who is the Lava Loca? 

In the small town of Volcano, located in the center of California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, there is a cafe that has been an institution for locals and tourists alike for over 40 years. The cafe is known as Lava Loca, and it is famous for its namesake dish: a lava flow made from layers of ground beef, refried beans, and cheese that flows over a bed of rice.

The cafe was opened in 1975 by Roberto and Hilda Urrea. Roberto had immigrated to the United States from Mexico in the 1950s, and he worked as a cook in various restaurants before opening his own place. Hilda was born in the United States to Mexican parents, and she grew up helping her parents run their restaurant. The two met when Roberto was working at Hilda's family's restaurant, and they married not long after they began dating.

Roberto was the head chef at Lava Loca from the beginning, and he created all of the recipes himself. He was known for his inventive combinations of flavors, and his dishes were always bursting with flavor. Hilda managed the front of the house, greeting customers and taking orders. The two worked together to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere at Lava Loca.

For over 40 years, Roberto and Hilda Urrea ran Lava Loca together. They treated their customers like family, and they became well-known for their friendly service and delicious food. In 2015, however, Roberto passed away suddenly at the age of 83. Hilda continued to run the cafe for a few more years before retiring in 2018.

Lava Loca is now run by Roberto's son-in-law Hector Hernandez and his wife Blanca. Hector has been working in restaurants since he was a teenager, so he knows firsthand what it takes to make great food. He has kept all of Roberto's recipes alive at Lava Loca, and he continues to serve up some of the best lava flows in town. Blanca helps him manage the business side of things, making sure that customers are happy and that everything runs smoothly at the cafe.

The Hernandez family has been running Lava Loca since 2018, and they continue to serve up some of the best lava flows in town. If you're looking for a delicious meal cooked with passion and love, then you should definitely visit Lava Loca!
