#  Russia has Dozens of Blackjack Bombers!

Russia has dozens of nuclear-capable bombers that can be armed with conventional or thermonuclear weapons, the commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces said Wednesday.

“Today Russia has a significant number of modern and advanced Tupolev Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers, which are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads,” Col. Gen. Viktor Bondarev said in a statement released by the Defense Ministry.

The bombers are currently stationed at airfields in Russia and Belarus and can take off within minutes to deliver strikes at targets within a radius of 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), he said.

The new revelation underscores the modernization of Russia’s strategic bomber force that has taken place over the past decade. The Kremlin has been pouring billions of rubles into refurbishing its once outdated military hardware as part of President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to boost Russia’s defense capabilities.

Putin last month hailed the revival of Russia’s strategic bomber force as a “major step forward” in enhancing the country’s defense capability.

#  Russia Deploys 100th Blackjack Bomber!

The Russian air force announced Monday the deployment of its 100th Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a move that comes amid heightened tensions with the West.

"Today we can announce that the 100th airplane of this type has been delivered to the Russian Aerospace Forces," Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a televised statement.

The Blackjack, which entered into service with the Soviet Union in 1981, is a supersonic strategic bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons. It is one of Russia's most advanced bombers and has been frequently used in airstrikes against opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Russia has continued to modernize its military since its 2014 annexation of Crimea, bolstering its forces in Crimea and Syria while also increasing spending on new weapons systems.

#  Russia Shows off its Newest Stealth Bomber, the Blackjack!

Moscow, Russia - The Russian Federation has today unveiled their newest bomber, the Tu-160M2 (NATO reporting name: "Blackjack"). The bomber made its first public flight demonstration at the MAKS airshow in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow. The new bomber is a major upgrade of the original Tu-160, which first flew in 1981.

The Tu-160M2 is a long-range strategic bomber that can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons. It is designed to penetrate enemy airspace and strike at vital targets deep within their territory. The new bomber is built around a pair of giant Kuznetsov NK-32 engines, which give it a top speed of Mach 2.35 (1,550 miles per hour). It is also equipped with advanced stealth features that make it difficult for enemy radar to track.

The Russian military has been seeking to rebuild its aging fleet of bombers in recent years. The Tu-160M2 is seen as a key part of this effort, and the Russian government has pledged to order at least 50 of them. With tensions rising between Russia and the West, it remains to be seen just how potent this new weapon will be on the modern battlefield.

#  Iranian Leader Threatens to Destroy Russia's 100 Blackjack Bombers

In a recent speech, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened to destroy Russia's 100 Blackjack bombers if they ventured into Iranian airspace. This dramatic escalation in tensions between the two countries comes amid heightened hostility in the region since the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran in May.

Ayatollah Khamenei warned that Iran would not tolerate any violation of its airspace by Russian warplanes, and that the Islamic Republic would respond with "full force" to any attack. He added that the Russian bombers were "not welcome" in Iran and that their presence would be met with a "severe response."

This is not the first time that Iran has threatened to retaliate against Russian aggression. In February, Iranian officials vowed to shoot down any Russian warplanes that enter Iranian airspace without permission. And in November, 2017, an Iranian general said that his country was prepared to defend itself against a potential Russian attack.

The deteriorating relationship between Iran and Russia comes as both countries are struggling with sanctions from the United States. The Trump administration has reimposed sanctions on Iran following its withdrawal from the nuclear deal, and has also imposed sanctions on Russia over its alleged involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK.

Despite these tensions, experts say that a military conflict between Iran and Russia is unlikely. However, the risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding leading to armed confrontation remains high, and both countries continue to build up their military capabilities in the region.

#  Russia Claims it Can Destroy any Target with its 100 Blackjack Bombers

Russia has announced that it can destroy any target on Earth with its 100 Blackjack bombers. The announcement was made by the Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu.

"The capabilities of our long-range aircraft have increased dramatically," Shoigu said. "We can now hit any target on the planet."

The 100 Blackjack bombers are nuclear-capable and are equipped with cruise missiles. Russia has also been developing a new stealth bomber, the PAK DA.

The announcement comes as tensions between Russia and the West continue to mount. The US has accused Russia of violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and the US has also begun deploying troops and military hardware to NATO member states in Eastern Europe.
