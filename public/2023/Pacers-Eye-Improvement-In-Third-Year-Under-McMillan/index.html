        <h1 id="Pacers-Eye-Improvement-In-Third-Year-Under-McMillan"><a href="#Pacers-Eye-Improvement-In-Third-Year-Under-McMillan" class="headerlink" title="Pacers Eye Improvement In Third Year Under McMillan"></a>Pacers Eye Improvement In Third Year Under McMillan</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers have been a steady playoff team during the tenure of head coach Nate McMillan, but they have yet to take that next step and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. This past season, the Pacers finished with a 48-34 record, good for fifth in the East, but they were eliminated in the first round by the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Now in his third year at the helm, McMillan is looking to help the Pacers take that next step. He feels confident that this team is capable of doing so, as they have a mix of veterans and young players who are still growing and maturing.</p>
<p>“We’re headed in the right direction,” said McMillan. “Our young guys are getting better and our veterans are still playing at a high level. I like where we’re at right now and I think we can do some special things this season.”</p>
<p>Most of the firepower for Indiana will come from their All-Star Victor Oladipo, who averaged 23 points per game last season. He will be joined in the starting lineup by Darren Collison, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young, and Myles Turner.</p>
<p>Other key contributors for the Pacers include Cory Joseph, Domantas Sabonis, Tyreke Evans, and Lance Stephenson. Evans was acquired from Memphis in the offseason and is expected to provide some much needed scoring off the bench.</p>
<p>Indiana has always been known for their toughness and defensive mindset under McMillan, and that will once again be a key factor if they hope to make a deep run in the playoffs this year. They finished eighth in defensive rating last season and will need to continue to play stout defense if they want to upset one of the top teams in the East.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that McMillan has this team heading in the right direction, but only time will tell if they can finally break through and reach new heights this season.</p>
<h1 id="3-Points-On-The-Board-For-Pacers-Look-To-Improve-Record"><a href="#3-Points-On-The-Board-For-Pacers-Look-To-Improve-Record" class="headerlink" title="3 Points On The Board For Pacers, Look To Improve Record"></a>3 Points On The Board For Pacers, Look To Improve Record</h1><p>The Pacers entered Wednesday night’s game against the Utah Jazz knowing they could solidify their playoff standing. A victory would give them a three-game cushion over the ninth-place Detroit Pistons with just 10 games remaining on the schedule.</p>
<p>Victor Oladipo and company didn’t disappoint, knocking off the Jazz 105-87 behind 25 points from Oladipo. They are now one step closer to where they want to be.</p>
<p>“It was a good win for us,” Oladipo said after the game. “We played well, especially defensively.”</p>
<p>While they may have gotten the win, they know they still have plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>“We’re not where we need to be yet,” Thaddeus Young admitted. “But every game we’re getting better and that’s what we need to continue to do.”</p>
<p>Here are three observations from Wednesday night’s game:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Pacers’ defense was suffocating once again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In their previous meeting with the Jazz, the Pacers held them to 97 points - 14 below their season average. On Wednesday night, they did it again, holding Utah to just 87 points. It was their fourth consecutive game holding their opponents under 100 points. They are now 19-3 this season when doing so.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bojan Bogdanovic had another strong game off the bench.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bogdanovic finished with 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting, including 4-of-8 from 3-point range. He has now scored in double figures in six straight games and eight of his last nine outings. He has become a vital part of this Pacers team off the bench.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Darren Collison looked more comfortable in his second game back from injury.</li>
</ol>
<p>Collison returned from a knee injury on Tuesday night and played 23 minutes against the Jazz, scoring eight points and dishing out four assists. He looked more comfortable on Wednesday night and should continue to get back into form as he gets more minutes under his belt.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Third-Season-Will-Be-A-Test"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Third-Season-Will-Be-A-Test" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Third Season Will Be A Test"></a>Indiana Pacers Third Season Will Be A Test</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers are coming off their best season in a long time. After making it to the playoffs and being within one game of the NBA Finals, they will be looking to build on that success this season. Their third season in the league is always a test, as teams typically find out if they are contenders or pretenders.</p>
<p>The Pacers have a lot of talent on their roster, led by Paul George and Roy Hibbert. They also have some good role players, including Lance Stephenson and George Hill. This team is capable of beating anyone in the league on any given night.</p>
<p>However, they also have some weaknesses. The biggest question mark for them is their bench. They lack quality depth at both the guard and forward positions. This could hurt them if they get into a tight playoff series against a good team.</p>
<p>The Pacers are definitely a contender this season. They should be able to win 50 games and make it back to the playoffs. However, they will need to improve their bench if they want to make a run at the NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Indiana-Pacers-Make-Playoffs-In-Third-Year"><a href="#Will-Indiana-Pacers-Make-Playoffs-In-Third-Year" class="headerlink" title="Will Indiana Pacers Make Playoffs In Third Year?"></a>Will Indiana Pacers Make Playoffs In Third Year?</h1><p>The Pacers had a busy offseason, they acquired Lance Stephenson from the Charlotte Hornets. The acquisition of Stephenson gives the Pacers another playmaker and scorer to put alongside George Hill and Paul George. Hibbert and West are back for their seventh season together. Stephenson is the wild card that could make the Pacers great this season or not work out at all.</p>
<p>The Indiana Pacers have made the playoffs in three consecutive seasons, but will they make it again this year?</p>
<p>Their starting lineup is very good with George Hill, Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, and Lance Stephenson. This lineup has a lot of experience together and should be able to gel quickly. They also have a great bench with Luis Scola, Chris Copeland, Rodney Stuckey, C.J. Watson, Donald Sloan, Ian Mahinmi, and Solomon Hill.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conference is weaker than it has been in a while with no clear-cut favorite. The Miami Heat are the defending champions, but they lost LeBron James in free agency. The Cleveland Cavaliers are the most popular pick to win the East with LeBron James back home, but they are unproven without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Other teams in the East include the Chicago Bulls, Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, and New York Knicks.</p>
<p>It is going to be tough for any team to knock off the Miami Heat or Cleveland Cavaliers in the East this season. However, if Lance Stephenson can fit in well with the team and play to his potential then I think the Indiana Pacers have a good chance of making it to the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<h1 id="Keep-An-Eye-On-Pacers’-Third-Season"><a href="#Keep-An-Eye-On-Pacers’-Third-Season" class="headerlink" title="Keep An Eye On Pacers’ Third Season"></a>Keep An Eye On Pacers’ Third Season</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers are on the verge of their third season in the NBA. This upcoming year is key for the future of the franchise, as they will have to make some tough decisions on player contracts and figure out who will lead them into the future.</p>
<p>If they can manage to stay afloat this season, they could very well be a playoff contender in the near future. However, if they falter, it could be a long road back to contention.</p>
<p>Here are three things to watch during the Pacers’ third season:</p>
<ol>
<li>The development of Myles Turner</li>
</ol>
<p>Myles Turner was drafted by the Pacers with the 11th overall pick in 2015. He had a solid rookie season, averaging 10 points and 5 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>This offseason, Turner has been working on expanding his game. He has added a three point shot to his arsenal, and has been working on becoming a more versatile scorer. With Paul George likely gone after this season, Turner will have to take on a larger role for the Pacers.</p>
<p>He is certainly capable of becoming a star in this league, and it will be interesting to see how he fares in his second year. If he can continue to develop at a rapid pace, the Pacers will be in good shape for the future.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The battle for starting point guard</li>
</ol>
<p>George Hill was traded to the Jazz last offseason, leaving a hole at point guard for the Pacers. Jeff Teague was brought in to fill that spot, but there is no clear-cut favorite for the starting job yet.</p>
<p>Both players have pros and cons when it comes to starting them. Teague is more of a traditional point guard who can create shots for himself and others. He is also an effective scorer and rebounder for his position. However, he can be inconsistent at times and can be turnover-prone.</p>
<p>Monta Ellis is more of a combo guard who can play both positions effectively. He is not as good of an overall player as Teague, but he is a better shooter and defender. His biggest strength is his ability to score in bunches, which could come in handy if Teague struggles offensively at times.</p>
<p>Whoever head coach Nate McMillan decides to start at point guard will have big shoes to fill with George Hill now gone. It will be interesting to see how this competition plays out over the course of the season.</p>
