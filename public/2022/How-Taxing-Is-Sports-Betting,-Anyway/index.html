But how much revenue does the industry generate, and where does that money go?</p>
<p>Sports betting is a massive industry, generating over $100 billion in revenue annually. The vast majority of that money, however, goes to illegal bookmakers. Only about 3 percent of the total amount wagered is bet legally through state-regulated sportsbooks.</p>
<p>That small slice of the pie, though, generates a significant amount of tax revenue for states. In Nevada, for example, sports betting generates more than $50 million in tax revenue each year. In New Jersey, which legalized sports betting in 2018, the industry is expected to generate over $500 million in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>
<p>So what’s all the fuss about? Why not just legalize sports betting and collect all that tax revenue?</p>
<p>The main issue is that while legalizing sports betting might generate significant tax revenue in the short term, it could also have negative long-term consequences. When gambling is legalized, it becomes more accessible and can lead to increased addiction and social problems.</p>
<p>For these reasons, many states are hesitant to legalize sports betting until they can be sure it will not have a negative impact on their citizens. Sports betting may be a big business, but it’s still unclear whether or not it’s worth the cost.</p>
<h1 id="How-Do-I-Figure-Out-What-To-Pay-In-Taxes-For-My-Sports-Betting-Winnings"><a href="#How-Do-I-Figure-Out-What-To-Pay-In-Taxes-For-My-Sports-Betting-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Figure Out What To Pay In Taxes For My Sports Betting Winnings?"></a>How Do I Figure Out What To Pay In Taxes For My Sports Betting Winnings?</h1><p>As a U.S. taxpayer, there are a few important things you need to keep in mind when reporting gambling winnings on your tax return:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling income is taxable and must be reported on your return, regardless of whether you had a winning or losing year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must report all of your gambling winnings as income, even if you don’t receive a Form W-2G (a form issued by casinos and other gaming establishments showing the amount of gambling winnings paid to you during the year).</p>
</li>
<li><p>To calculate your taxable gambling income, simply add up the total amount you won during the year. This includes cash prizes, the fair market value of complimentary items (like cars and trips), and any other benefits received as a result of your gambling wins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses can be claimed as a deduction against your gambling income, but only up to the amount of your winnings. In other words, you can’t use your losses to offset other types of income. If you have more losses than wins, unfortunately you can’t claim a deduction for the excess amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must include Form W-2G (or other documentation from the casino or gaming establishment) in your tax package if the total amount shown on all Forms W-2G is more than $600 for the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When filing your tax return, be sure to use either Schedule C or Schedule A (depending on whether you are self-employed or not), depending on whether your gambling activity constitutes a business or hobby.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> So what does all this mean for sports bettors? Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<p> Say you placed ten $100 bets throughout the year, winning five times and losing five times. Your total gambling winnings for the year would be $500 ($100 x 5). Since your losses matched your wins, you don’t have to report anything on your tax return. However, if you had won six times and lost four times, your taxable gambling income would be $600 ($100 x 6). In this scenario, you would need to include Form W-2G with your tax return documentation because the total amount shown on all Forms W-2G is more than $600.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-You-Owe-Us-Money-If-You-Won-A-Sports-Bet-In-2014"><a href="#IRS-You-Owe-Us-Money-If-You-Won-A-Sports-Bet-In-2014" class="headerlink" title="IRS: You Owe Us Money If You Won A Sports Bet In 2014"></a>IRS: You Owe Us Money If You Won A Sports Bet In 2014</h1><p>As if the U.S. tax code wasn’t already complicated enough, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a new guidance stating that taxpayers who won any sports bets in 2014 may need to pay taxes on their winnings.</p>
<p>“This guidance applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, poker, and horse racing,” said IRS spokesperson Michelle Eldridge. “Whether you won or lost, you must report your gambling winnings and losses on your tax return.”</p>
<p>Eldridge went on to say that the new guidance was issued in response to several recent court cases in which gamblers had unsuccessfully tried to argue that their winnings were not taxable. “The courts have made clear that gambling winnings are taxable regardless of whether they are derived from legal or illegal activities,” she said.</p>
<p>So if you cashed in on any winning bets last year, make sure you report that income on your tax return. And if you lost money gambling, you can deduct those losses as well. For more information on how to report gambling income and losses, consult your tax advisor or visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.irs.gov/">www.IRS.gov</a>.</p>
<h1 id="1099-MISC-Form-For-Sports-Betting-Winnings"><a href="#1099-MISC-Form-For-Sports-Betting-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="1099-MISC Form For Sports Betting Winnings"></a>1099-MISC Form For Sports Betting Winnings</h1><p>The 1099-MISC form is used to report payments and other income to recipients other than employees. The form is also used to report certain types of self-employment income. If you have received more than $10,000 in sports betting winnings during the tax year, you will need to report this income on your 1099-MISC form.</p>
<p>In order to complete Form 1099-MISC, you will need the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your name and address</li>
<li>The name and address of the payer</li>
<li>The amount of the payments</li>
<li>The date the payments were made</li>
<li>A description of the payments</li>
<li>The payer’s federal identification number (FEIN)</li>
<li>Your taxpayer identification number (TIN)</li>
</ol>
<p>Your TIN can be either your Social Security number or your employer identification number (EIN). If you are a sole proprietor, your EIN is your TIN. You should also enter “S” in the box for state or foreign country.</p>
<p>The amount of your sports betting winnings should be reported on Line 21 of Form 1099-MISC as Other Income. This amount will be included in your total taxable income for the year and will be taxed accordingly.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses-From-My-Sports-Betting-Winnings"><a href="#Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses-From-My-Sports-Betting-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses From My Sports Betting Winnings"></a>Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses From My Sports Betting Winnings</h1><p>In the United States, you can only deduct gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. For most people, this isn’t worth the hassle of tracking all of your losses and keeping receipts.</p>
<p>In order to claim your losses, you need to have documentation of the amount you lost. This documentation can be in the form of canceled checks, statements from the gambling establishment, or wagers slips and tickets. If you didn’t keep track of how much you lost, you can estimate it using a reasonable method.</p>
<p>You can also only claim losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $500 but lost $600, you can only claim $500 in losses.</p>
<p>If you’re subject to U.S. tax law, you can only claim gambling losses on income that’s considered taxable. Gambling income is any payout that’s more than the total amount of your wagers. This includes winnings from slots, lotteries, and races (horse, dog, etc.).</p>
<p>It’s important to note that just because you can deduct your gambling losses doesn’t mean that it’s a smart financial decision. In fact, it may be best to simply avoid gambling altogether if you’re prone to losing money.</p>
